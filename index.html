    Design a blog
22 APRIL 2016
Create a website that contains the following:
A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down)
A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the center of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.
Each blog post should have a title of some kind
Each blog post should have the date it was "published"
Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text.
The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you can just put filler text (lorem ipsum) there if you want.

                <h2>What You Do Matters!</h2>
                
                <p>2020 Designated as the year of the nurse and Midwife. Come on people, Nurse curse anyone… Earthquakes, Viruses, Pandemics, Protests, riots, and two people in a race that once again makes me feel the Terminator as Governor feel more normal. I have had a particular thought in my head now for months and with it leading to the time of year I use to enjoy and now still kind of dread; why not try and get my thoughts out.
                I can't remember where or who I heard it from, but I have heard "What you do matters." I do feel that and understand that, but I think it comes down to how do you want to matter. I mean starting college and deciding on getting my BSN, I did tell several people I never wanted to be a Labor and Delivery Nurse. But then half-way through school, I got a job that I didn't truly understand all it would involve and became a Patient Care Technician for an L&D floor and met some pretty amazing people that changed my view on being an L&D Nurse. That mattered. 
                Now a lot of the time when I tell people what kind of job I have I usually get some variation of "oh you get to hold the babies all day." Sometimes, I correct them, sometimes I just smile and nod. If only that is all that my job entailed. I hate crying in front of people, I don't know if that is just me or what, but if I start feeling teary I try to find some alone time. Even, if it is at work. However, it does not always work out that way. I was a few months into working as an L&D nurse when I had to take care of my first fetal demise patient. I knew it would happen at some point and that it would be tough and sad, it always is. But after she delivered and was stable I walked away because I needed a minute. I did not find a private enough spot I guess and the provider for my patient saw me. Now, remember, I said what you do matters. What do you think the provider response was? Granted I had worked with this individual before and was not expecting much if anything to be honest. But the provider stopped and said, "Why are you crying, it only gets worse from here.", and then she continued on her way. Needless to say, I did not necessarily appreciate that particular sentiment at that moment. "What you do matters." Everything you do matters; remember that, but I think it is important to think of how you will matter.
                That memory reflects on the beginning of my L&D career. I still remember what that provider said but I am still me. When I get those patients I still feel, still cry sometimes with them and sometimes by myself. But think, what if I was close to that line, you know the line where a person is thinking if I just get one more and I'm done. That pushed you past your limit and you can't deal with what this does to yourself. Come the end of this December and I will have been a Nurse for 10 years and through that time I have had some shifts where at times I felt like I was inching to that line but then the rest of the time I generally experience moments and times that continually show me why I became a nurse and I get away from that line
                There is a shift that I had that for a time I felt like it pushed me to my limit, so over that line that to this day I have not told people that I interviewed and nearly accepted a job offer because I felt so done. "What you do matters." Remember, how do you want to matter is important to. That particular shift was very hard on me in so many different ways and there are only a few reasons I'm still working as an L&D nurse and a big one is my immediate coworkers. They were there during that shift helping me, working together. They were thereafter when I could not sleep and cried for days. They were there telling me not to stop, pushing me back behind that line and I could not be more grateful to all of them for what they did and still do for me.
                So as we all get closer to the finale of the Jumanji of a year I just leave you with this; as you go about your daily lives just know that "What you do Matters.", but also think about how you want to matter too. The next person you may meet or encounter may just be really close to that line and you may have the power in you to push them away from the line or over it….it matters.</p>
